Hello! I'm Dan McCann, and this is my website.  It is still under construction. 

I'm a graphics programmer interested in procedural art and design, rendering, and entertainment technology in general. 

I earned a B.S.E. in Digital Media Design at University of Pennsylvania in 2017, and an M.S.E. in Computer Graphics and Game Technology at the same university in 2018.

Take a gander at my portfolio, hopefully you find something interesting!
